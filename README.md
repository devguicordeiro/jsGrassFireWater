# jsGrassFireWater(RPS)

After some time stuck in this code and because i was short on time to code
the project is finished. i was abble to learn a lot by solving problems
the game is functional, but i'm not done yet. i'll keep moving things in the next
days but a little less than usual.

it was actually really fun working on this project. i'll be moving forward with
the studiying of JS and probabilly after a while get into reactJS
